Sure! Here's a README file for the compound interest calculator project:

# Compound Interest Calculator

This is a simple C program that calculates compound interest, taking into account the principal amount, interest rate, time period (in years), and monthly contributions to the account.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you compile and run the program on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

To run this program, you'll need a C compiler. If you are on macOS or Linux, you likely have GCC installed by default. If not, you can install it from your package manager. For Windows users, you can install MinGW or use an IDE like Code::Blocks, Dev-C++, or Visual Studio.

### Compiling the Code

1. Save the C code in a file named `compound_interest.c`.

2. Open a terminal (or command prompt for Windows) and navigate to the directory where the `compound_interest.c` file is located.

3. Use the C compiler to compile the code. For example, if you are using GCC, run the following command:
   ```
   gcc -o compound_interest compound_interest.c
   ```

4. If there are no errors, the compilation will create an executable file named `compound_interest` in the same directory.

### Running the Program

1. After successful compilation, run the program by entering the following command in the terminal (or command prompt for Windows):
   ```
   ./compound_interest
   ```

2. The program will prompt you to enter the principal amount, interest rate (in decimal), time period (in years), and the monthly contribution to the account.

3. After providing these inputs, the program will display the total amount of money accumulated after the given time period, considering the compound interest and monthly contributions.

## Example Usage

```
Enter the principal amount: 1000
Enter the interest rate (in decimal): 0.05
Enter the time (in years): 5
Enter the monthly contribution: 100
Total Amount after 5.00 years: 6938.85
```
